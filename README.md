Did Vehicle-Detection and Tracking using KLT , the main purpose of this project was to test the limits of KLT.
In the end we were able to:
1) Detecting features for all the cars in a video
2) Tracking key points across frame which helped us to track the motion of every car in the video
3) Were able to implement a YOLO-style object detection of vehicles using KLT only.
